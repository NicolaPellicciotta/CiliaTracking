# CiliaTracking
Hi, here there is the code for tracking cilia waveform and find the force with resistive force theory.
Only concern, you need to have your video in .movie format. If you do not have it, first convert your videos in a series of tiff (with numbers).
You can use Image J for this. THen you can use the tiff2movie.c to convert your tiffs to a .movie file. 
tiff2movie is comment at the beginning.

Code was developed by Luigi Feriani, I have only used and make it usable for other users. 

The code is decribed in E.Hamilton et al. (2019) "Motile cilia hydrodynamics: Entrainment versus synchronisation when coupling through ï¬‚ow" Philosophical Transaction B. 

Use matlab and load all the function in your path. Then open workflow.m , this is a script that will guide you.
For any problem write me.
